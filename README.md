# 🏢 SMECompany: End-to-End SQL Project

This project contains a comprehensive set of SQL scripts designed to simulate real-world data operations for a small-to-medium enterprise (SME). It covers database creation, data manipulation, joins, filtering, aggregation, views, stored procedures, and data cleaning—ideal for strengthening practical SQL skills.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to build a fully functional SQL-based system that manages customer, order, employee, and product data for a fictional SME. It demonstrates CRUD operations, joins, analytical queries, and procedural SQL, making it a perfect end-to-end learning and portfolio project.

## 👩‍💻 My Role
I designed and implemented the entire project structure from scratch, wrote optimized SQL scripts, simulated realistic business scenarios, and applied data cleaning and transformation best practices.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Database Creation:** Set up a MySQL database `SMECompany`.
- **Customer Management:** Insert, update, delete, and query customer data.
- **Order Processing:** Simulate purchases, calculate discounts, and apply filters.
- **Product Inventory:** Manage inventory by category, filter with regex, and analyze price trends.
- **Employee Records:** Maintain employee data and perform role-based grouping and hiring analysis.
- **Joins & CTEs:** Perform multiple types of joins, aggregations, and common table expressions.
- **Window Functions:** Use `OVER()` for running totals and customer segmentation.
- **Stored Procedures:** Automate tasks like customer-order inserts and view updates.
- **Temporary Tables:** Use temporary structures for quick transformations and insights.
- **Data Cleaning:** Trim whitespaces, fix formatting issues, apply casing rules, and substring extractions.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **MySQL** – For all relational database operations
- **SQL (DDL, DML, DQL, DCL)** – For defining, manipulating, querying, and securing data

## 🚀 Outcomes
- Simulated real-life company operations with realistic datasets
- Applied advanced SQL logic like `CASE`, `REGEXP`, `CTEs`, `HAVING`, and window functions
- Created reusable stored procedures and automated logic flows
- Cleaned and standardized messy data entries using SQL string functions

## 📌 Key Learning Points
| Challenge                              | Solution                                                   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Creating realistic datasets             | Designed varied and structured mock records                |
| Handling messy text data               | Used `TRIM`, `REPLACE`, `LOWER/UPPER`, and `SUBSTRING`     |
| Analyzing sales by segment             | Implemented `CASE` logic and window functions              |
| Automating queries                     | Wrote and executed custom `STORED PROCEDURES`              |
| Joining complex tables                 | Mastered various `JOIN` strategies and CTE usage           |

## 📥 How to Use
- Clone the repo and run the `.sql` scripts in a MySQL-compatible environment (like MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin).
- Follow the script order: create database → tables → insert data → analysis → procedures.
- Modify the queries to fit different business use cases or extend the database with new tables.
